## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Nick - organization and project management; js most capable coding skill
Zoe - Good with logic construction in JS, I stay up late to get things done.
Nerissa - HTML structure, CSS
Hunter- Time management; basic knowledge of JS and html set up.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Nick - Keep focus on the tasks most needed to continue together
Zoe - To get ahead or prevent us from falling behind I’ll finish up loose ends later.
Nerissa - To work together as a team
Hunter - being able to work with the team within the hours and providing the base levels I have to the group.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Nick - CSS with js; mob/pair coding with stronger teammates to help boost my effectiveness
Zoe - Definitely being able to read other peoples code and advanced tools.
Nerissa - JavaScript, technical communication in pair programming
Hunter - javaScript and css tools.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Build a plan for the day (checklist perhaps) during a morning 10-min huddle; consider individual  strengths, divvy workload amongst team; if struggling ask for pair/team help afternoon check-n for end of day tasks and needs for the next day.  Take regularly scheduled “human time” each hour. If someone is spinning their wheels (15-min rule); speak up.
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Address immediately
Inform all team members
Listen, analyze, develop a resolution jointly (if possible)

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Inform team member of concern
Develop alternate work plan

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Acknowledge strengths and weaknesses
Willingness to assist
Patience
Utilize pair/mob programming when needed
Team huddle on concepts
Communicate

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Ask/reach out, don’t assume
Mutual communication
Professionalism
Empathy is needed

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
After an unsuccessful group resolution meeting; notify instructor of issues not solvable within team

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Nick - 0700 - 1900 PST 1400-1600 squishy due to personal stuff
Zoe - 0600 - Midnight PST (Everyday)
Nerissa - 0600 - 2100 PST
Hunter - 0400 - 2100 PST m-f. Open sat-sun

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)
Slack
How often will you take breaks?
Hourly (10 mins)

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Re-evaluate the necessity of our tasks, determine if we have to rescale our plan. 

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Allowing everyone the opportunity to speak in the meetings. 
Open to voices anytime

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Constructive criticism only

Have an open mindset when listening to others.
Be respectful and mindful


## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:

How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Talk about what needs to be worked on for the day.
Inform chat of completions and not wait for a meeting to inform completion.
Update project board.

What project management tool will be used?
GitHub Projects
Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
301 Group C Mid/Final Project Deck Template

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
Planning to present at 1130am Thursday PST (practice presentation)
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.

When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process

What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Use GitHub for projects

How will you share the repository with your teammates?
Created organization for this project, access available for team

What is your Git flow?
Create branches for each work (individual)
peer/code review
2 people will be merging on Main branch
Individual branches of development branch

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

1 for development branch

Who merges PRs?
Primary: Zoe
Secondary: Nick

How often will you merge?

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Primary: Slack channel
Test: Live Share in VS Code
